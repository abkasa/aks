## Using python and the attached sample data of an e-commerce database of user purchases, develop a model that would:

1. Contains Exploratory Data Analysis 
   
2. Be able to classify customers into segments and anticipates the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year and this, from its first purchase by assigning them appropriate cluster/segment 
   
3. Prefix "C" denotes a cancelled transaction, based on the indicator, we observe that when an order is cancelled, there will be another transaction in the dataframe with the same attributes but with negative quantity. Locate these entries and check if there are correlation between orders indicating the same quantity (but positive), with the same description (**CustomerID**, **Description** and **UnitPrice**). State whether the hypothesis of "when an order has a negative quantity value, this would always means that the order has been canceled" is true or not.
   
4. In the data-frame, products are uniquely identified through the **StockCode** variable. A short description of the products is given in the **Description** variable. Use the content of this variable in order to group the products into different categories.
